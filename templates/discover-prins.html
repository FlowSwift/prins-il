      <h2>Strong brand</h2>
      <p>Prins is a family company. For over more than fifty years, three generations of the Verkade family
        have
        been
        putting their heart and soul into animal food. Prins feels a bit like family to all of our employees.
        Working from
        three premises at the Accustraat in Veenendaal, we are -through manufacturing and education,
        experience-driven
        motivaton and enthusiasm, building on a strong and fast growing brand, which is also drawing
        international
        attention.</p>

      <h2>Quality</h2>
      <p>Our secret? Prins's culture, where everyone has the same goal; quality first. Quality that goes
        beyond
        labels and
        that we are keen on surpassing, because we are not easily satisfied. Maybe we can change something, or
        improve.
        Customers are critical, and they should be. We appreciate mindful and committed people. We want to
        give the
        consumers our sincere attention by creating great products for healthy pets and also specifically
        through
        good,
        professional advice.</p>

        <h2>Natural food for dogs and cats</h2>
        <p>Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of making healthy choices when it comes to food and feeding their pets. That's why at Prins, we think before we act. Even when something sounds great from a marketing perspective, we ask ourselves if it's really in the interest of the animal's well-being. We make deliberate choices and focus mainly on health for the future. On food that can help reduce obesity, on menu's that, with the help of the latest techniques, can be optimally tailored to the individual and on exercising together with your pet.&nbsp;We are a way of life.</p>
